  <h1> Introduction </h1>
</center>

  <p markdown="1"> As the previous quote by biologist [Colin Tudge](http://www.colintudge.com/) espouses, trees play an essential role in the lives of humans, animals, and plants in the physical environment. Research on the widespread aesthetic, physical, and public health benefits of trees have led policymakers in urban areas that have previously been labeled as “concrete jungles” to begin expanding the tree canopy coverage in their cities through the planting of urban forests and other green spaces (“Benefits of trees”, 2019; Endreny, 2018; Kabisch et al., 2017). </p>
  
  <p> Studies conducted by environmental experts has supported these initiatives through findings that urban forests reduce carbon emissions and mitigate global warming (Johnson et al., 2013; Malmsheimer et al., 2011; McPherson & Simpson, 1999; Russo et al., 2015; Zhao et al., 2010; Zheng et al., 2013). For example, a 2011 study conducted by the U.S. Forest Service iterated that that reducing greenhouse gases in the environment requires the creation of new forests (Malmsheimer et al., 2011), while an earlier study by McPherson & Simpson (1999) specifically focused on providing a guide for conservationists and business/industry executives to increase tree canopy coverage in communities and offset carbon dioxide emissions. Other studies such as those conducted by Johnson et al. (2013) and Russo et al. (2015) suggested urban forests as a way to reduce the effects of transportation on climate change and research by Zhao et al. (2010) and Zheng et al. (2013) provided overarching summaries of the benefits of urban forests. </p>

   <p> Similarly, investigations performed by socioeconomic and public health researchers have simultaneously espoused that trees and urban green spaces have a positive correlation with health and well-being in human living environments (Daams & Veneri, 2016; Dadvand et al., 2014; Dadvand et al., 2018; De Vries et al., 2007; Donovan, 2017; Faber Taylor & Kuo, 2011; King et al., 2015; Reid et al., 2017; Taylor et al., 1998; Turner‐Skoff & Cavender, 2019; U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, 2018; Ulmer et al., 2016). Studies by Dadvand et al (2014), Dadvand et al. (2018), Faber Taylor & Kuo (2011), Kabisch et al. (2017), Reid et al. (2017), the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service (2018), and Ulmer et al. (2016) all found that urban green spaces have significant benefits on the physical and mental health and well-being of individuals, particularly those who suffer from chronic illnesses and developmental difficulties such as obesity, asthma, allergies, diabetes, and ADHD. Other research by De Vries et al. (2007) and King et al. (2015) explore urban forests as outlets for safe play in inner-city areas while Turner et al. (2019) highlighted that trees are important for creating sustainable living environments. </p>
  
  <p> Following these scientific findings, cities have begun the task of creating databases to identify where trees are currently located in their communities and identify where new urban forests are needed (Poon, 2018).  However, the financial and human capital required to create these databases, known as tree censuses, are substantial (Poon, 2018).</p>
  
  <p> The city-wide TreesCount! census that was conducted in New York City, required 12,000 volunteer hours from 2,200 citizen mappers who were trained to utilize “high tech mapping tools with survey wheels, tape measures, and tree identification keys” according to a method developed by a non-profit organization, TreeKIT (“TreesCount!”, 2017). This volunteer work saved the city over $100,000 in survey costs, however even with such a large amount of volunteer hours, it took almost a year and a half to complete the census (“TreesCount!”, 2017). Although this was an intuitive way to save money and help “citizen mappers” and “citizen scientists” discover the importance of trees, many organizations do not have access to such a large pool of volunteers and/or are unable to wait years for results (Butt et al., 2013; Poon, 2018, “TreesCount!”, 2017). Therefore, cities and nonprofit groups are in dire need of a secondary assessment method that is quicker, less labor-intensive, and more affordable. </p>
  
  <p> In recent years, remote spatial data analysis tools have emerged as a viable option (Li et al., 2019; Lin et al., 2015; Ren et al., 2015; Tigges & Lakes, 2017). Remote spatial data analysis is a broad field that relies on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and remote sensing (RS) techniques to combine high-quality optical images and LiDAR data into a "fast, replicable, objective, efficient, scalable, and cost-effective way to assess and quantify urban forest dynamics at varying spatiotemporal scales” (Li et al., 2019, p. 2; Lin et al., 2015; Poon, 2018; Tigges & Lakes, 2017). Research conducted by Li et al. (2019) and Poon (2018) explored the importance of improving methods to quantify urban forests while other analyses such as those conducted by Lin et al. (2015), Ren et al. (2015) and Tigges & Lakes (2017), have examined the strengths and limitations of available software. </p>
  
  <p> One area of consensus, though, is that the relatively cost-effective nature of these technologies make them into an important area of future research and an invaluable tool that is particularly attractive to advocates for open-data initiatives (Silva et al, 2018). Subsequently, these researchers have designed several software packages for the open-source data analysis language R (Silva et al., 2018).  It is the goal of this project to examine these software packages and produce a guide that determines the current feasibility of conducting remote tree censuses in an open-source format when the appropriate LiDAR data is available. </p>
